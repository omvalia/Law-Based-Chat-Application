## LAw Based Chat Application
I have developed a law-focused chat application designed to handle queries strictly related to legal matters, utilizing specialized law-based data as its knowledge source. This application ensures that it only responds to legal inquiries and filters out irrelevant or non-law-related questions. The frontend of the application is built using the Chainlit library, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for seamless interaction. On the backend, I integrated the Llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin large language model (LLM), which powers the natural language understanding and response generation tailored to legal contexts. 

This project aims to streamline legal assistance by providing accurate, law-based responses to user queries, making it a valuable tool for anyone seeking legal information or clarity on legal matters. By leveraging advanced AI models, the chat application enhances accessibility to legal knowledge and supports a wide range of legal scenarios, from basic legal inquiries to more complex case-related questions. The application's robust data filtering ensures that it delivers precise, contextually appropriate answers, making it an effective resource for legal professionals and individuals alike.
